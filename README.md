# PlaneSavingPassengers

## A little review:
All your passengers made an emergency jump from the plane following a bird attack!
Your mission - to collect as many passengers as possible on the way, and avoid collisions with the birds! Their lives depend on you!


## How to play: 
You need to move right and left, and for that there are two options:
First option - two buttons.
Second option - to move your phone right and left.

## On the project:
We needed to create a game with 3 pages - menu, game and end game.

In the menu page, you can choose the difficulty level of the game and how to move the plane.
The higher the level, the more difficult the game.
You can move the plane with buttons or by moving the phone.
You can move to the game page or to the end game page.

In the game page you get to play the game.

In the end game page, you can see your scores in  a list and the best score on a map.
By clicking on an object in the list you can zoom in on the location where this particular score was achieved.

We save the scores with Shared Preferences, and get them from there as well.

We request permission to access the location, and if the user allows it, we can let the player save his score with his current location where he achieved it.

We used Google Maps API to display the scores on the map.


## Development environment:
We used Android Studio to develop the project.
